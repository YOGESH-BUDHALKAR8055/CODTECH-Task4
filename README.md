# Voice Recognition System Using ESP32 and V3 Module

![Project Banner](https://example.com/banner-image.png) <!-- Replace with your project's banner image link -->

## üìñ Description
This project demonstrates a **voice recognition system** using the **ESP32 microcontroller**, a **V3 speech recognition module**, and an LED. The system responds to predefined voice commands to control an LED, showcasing how voice interaction can be implemented in embedded systems.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Voice-controlled LED operation ("TURN ON" and "TURN OFF").
- Modular design using the ESP32 and V3 speech recognition module.
- Real-time command processing and execution.
- Scalable for additional voice-controlled devices or actions.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Components Required**
- **ESP32** board
- **V3 Speech Recognition Module**
- LED and 220Œ© resistor
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- USB cable for programming the ESP32

### 2. **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following software/tools are installed:
- **Arduino IDE** (with ESP32 board support)
- **V3 Speech Module configuration software** (for command training)
- USB-to-TTL converter (optional, for configuring the module)

---

## ‚ö° How It Works
1. The **V3 Speech Recognition Module** captures and processes voice commands.
2. Recognized commands are sent to the ESP32 via serial communication.
3. The ESP32 executes actions based on the commands:
   - **"TURN ON"** ‚Üí Turns the LED ON.
   - **"TURN OFF"** ‚Üí Turns the LED OFF.
